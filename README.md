# Music_Organizer
A python script to organize my music files on Android.

The root directory for music is called "Playlist", divided as subdirectory with the name of the artist.

If there is less than 3 music per artist, the music is categorized as others, moved under the folder name "Others" which is divided as genre name of the music.


Here's the directory tree

/storage/emulated/0/Playlist/'Artist Name' or Others/"Genre Name"

Requires python that has access to android directory.
